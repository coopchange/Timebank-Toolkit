# Timebank Toolkit: a working guide for Timebank Administrators 

_Keeping the core values of reciprocity and community – and the people who bring it to life – at heart_

## Who is this toolkit for?

We aim to benefit:
- the coordinators, steering committees, and admins, of [Aotearoa / New Zealand’s timebanks](TimebanksANZ.md)
- new or old, big or small, rural or urban
- the practice of timebanking, in its many flavours

## Introduction
During the second half of 2021 [Wellington Timebank](https://wellingtonsouth.timebanks.org) funded a [research project](http://www.newtowncommunity.org.nz/timebank-toolkit.md) which was tasked with developing a toolkit for Timebank coordinators and administrators. The broad purpose of the research was to document [our collective experience](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1f6Fky5CK_OfiQzhPGYmj78ezXj6Ov03WlkWU3oR77gE/edit#slide=id.p) and to [use the findings](Findings.md)  to provide administrators with this document which has a more practical focus, and a complementary document which provides [broader discussion of the activities they will engage in](Toolkit.md).


## Setting up a Timebank

Section one: [Setting up a Timebank](section_01.md)

This section looks at everything you need to do to setup a timebank. It will look in detail at how to create a core group; securing funding for your group; building your community; choosing a platform for Timebanking; running activities; and considerations for managing a website.

## Membership and Administration

Section two: [Membership and Administration](section_02.md)

This section deals with the nitty-gritty that is involved with sign-up and membership administration. Getting people to join your Timebank and managing the processes involved is not as simple as it appears. It can be time-consuming, especially when you are assisting several people at once. It will cover reference checks, process management, police checks, and orientation sessions.
 

## Running a Timebank 

Section three: [Running a Timebank](section_03.md)

This section deals with communications, networking, and engagement. 
It will discuss newsletters; social media engagement; content creation; what apps and software to use; monthly meetings; and organisation guidelines.
