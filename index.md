# Timebank Toolkit
## A working guide for Timebank Administrators 

_Keeping the core values of reciprocity and community – and the people who bring it to life – at heart_

During the second half of 2021 [Wellington Timebank](https://wellingtonsouth.timebanks.org) funded a [research project](http://www.newtowncommunity.org.nz/timebank-toolkit.md) which was tasked with developing a toolkit for Timebank coordinators and administrators. The broad purpose of the research was to document [our collective experience](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1f6Fky5CK_OfiQzhPGYmj78ezXj6Ov03WlkWU3oR77gE/edit#slide=id.p) and to [use that information](Findings.md) as [a basis for easier administration](Toolkit.md) of the Timebanks. 


### Who this is for

We aim to benefit:
- the coordinators, steering committees, and admins, of [Aotearoa / New Zealand’s timebanks](TimebanksANZ.md)
- new or old, big or small, rural or urban
- the practice of timebanking, in its many flavours
