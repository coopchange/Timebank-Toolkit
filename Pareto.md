# Pareto Analysis (a.k.a., the 80/20 rule)  
  
The 80/20 rule is a technique created by the Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto. It’s the idea that 20% of actions are responsible for 80% of outcomes. The goal of Pareto analysis is to help you prioritize tasks that are most effective at solving problems.

## How it works 
  
**List some of the problems you are facing.**  
 For example, you have a backlog of things that you need to get done  
  
**Identify the root cause of each problem.** 
Maybe the backlog is because your time is being spent on other people’s tasks.  
  
**Assign a score to each problem**  
 Assign higher numbers to more important problems  
  
**Group problems together by cause**  
 Group together all the problems caused by spending your time on other people’s work.  
  
**Add up the score of each group**  
 The group with the highest score is the issue you should work on first.  
  
**Take action**
