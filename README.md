# Timebank-Toolkit
## A working guide for Timebank Administrators 

During the second half of 2021 Wellington Timebank funded a research project which was tasked with developing a toolkit for Timebank coordinators and administrators. The broad outline is to document our collective experience and to use the information as a basis for easier administration of the Timebanks.

### Who this is for
We aim to benefit:
1. the coordinators, steering committees, and admins, of Aotearoa New Zealandâ€™s timebanks
2. new or old, big or small, rural or urban
3. the practice of timebanking, in its many flavours

### Contributing 
If you want to participate in an ongoing way you can fork the toolkit. When you are ready, send a pull request through to our repo. 

If you want to contribute in an ad-hoc way, simply send us an issue request and we'll address the suggestions that you have.
