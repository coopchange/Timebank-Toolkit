# Timebank-Toolkit
## A working guide for Timebank Administrators 

Keeping the core values of reciprocity and community – and the people who bring it to life – at heart.

During the second half of 2021 Wellington Timebank funded a research project which was tasked with developing a toolkit for Timebank coordinators and administrators. The broad outline is to document our collective experience and to use the information as a basis for easier administration of the Timebanks.

### Who this is for
We aim to benefit:

1. the coordinators, steering committees, and admins, of Aotearoa New Zealand’s timebanks
2. new or old, big or small, rural or urban
3. the practice of timebanking, in its many flavours
