# Timebank-Toolkit
## A working guide for Timebank Administrators 

Keeping the core values of reciprocity and community – and the people who bring it to life – at heart.

### Who this is for

We aim to benefit:
- the coordinators, steering committees, and admins, of Aotearoa New Zealand’s timebanks
- new or old, big or small, rural or urban
- the practice of timebanking, in its many flavours

### Who are We
The [Wellington Timebank](https://wellingtonsouth.timebanks.org) is based in Pōneke, Wellington New Zealand.  We are are reasonably large and active group with 760 members at the end of 2021. The Wellington Timebank originally began as the Wellington South Timebank in 2011. Due to growing interest from across the central Wellington area, we expanded and became the Wellington Timebank in 2012. Now we are a community of people from all over the central Wellington area. 

#### Vision
In our community we look out for each other and embrace diversity.

#### Mission
Through exchanging skills, time and knowledge we foster relationships of trust and reciprocity. We harness the real wealth of the community and the value of each individual.

#### Values
1. We are all assets. Every person has something to contribute.
2. Redefining work: All kinds of work need to be honoured and rewarded.
3. Reciprocity. Relationships are about giving and receiving. "You need me" becomes "We need each other".
4. Social networks. People helping each other weaves communities of support, strength and trust.
5. Respect. All of us matter and are accountable to one another.

During the second half of 2021 Wellington South Timebank funded a research project which was tasked with developing a toolkit for Timebank coordinators and administrators.
