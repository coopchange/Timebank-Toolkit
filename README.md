# Timebank-Toolkit
## A working guide for Timebank Administrators 

Keeping the core values of reciprocity and community – and the people who bring it to life – at heart.

### Who this is for

We aim to benefit:
- the coordinators, steering committees, and admins, of Aotearoa New Zealand’s timebanks
- new or old, big or small, rural or urban
- the practice of timebanking, in its many flavours
