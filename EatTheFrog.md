# Eat the Frog Technique  
  
> “Eat a live frog the first thing in the morning and nothing worse will happen to you the rest of the day.”

Start your day by doing the most onerous tasks first and getting them out of the way.  
  
``Good for``  Overcoming obstacles  
  
``Good for`` Chipping away at large jobs  
  
## How it works
  
1.    **Get clear on a goal**. What do you want to achieve most?  
  
2.    **Write it down**.  
  
3.    **Set a deadline**.  
  
4.    **Compile a list** of things you need to do to achieve your goal.  
  
5.    **Organize this list in order of priority**. The most important items are probably the most difficult. These are your “frogs.”  
  
6.    **Take action**. If you have more than one frog on your plate, eat the nastiest one first.  
  
7.    **Repeat this cycle every day** so that you’re always doing something that will push you toward your goal.
