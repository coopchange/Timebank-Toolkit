When setting up a Timebank you will need to decide on a sign up process. Can the person sign up solely online or do they need to meet in person? Here is an example of a sign up process... LINK COLINS SIGN UP PROCESS DOC. If you decide it can be done online then you can either use CW3 directly - you will receive an email when a new member signs up, and you can then respond directly to this with an email with sign up details (EXAMPLE OF SIGN UP DETAIL EMAIL) or you could have a google form (EXAMPLE OF G FORM) that will create a user database on excel that you can use to keep track of sign ups. You could also use an integrator tool (EXAMPLE OF TOOL) to send an automatic email. (EXAMPLE OF INTEGRATOR TOOL USES - e.g create trello board, send sign up response, send referee check etc). 

Reference checks for new sign ups - if you decide to do reference checks, how might you conduct these - you could do it the old fashioned way by calling the referees, or you could use a google form (EXAMPLE OF GOOGLE FORM) 

Keeping track of your sign up process - where are you in the process? What tools can you use to keep track of this? (EXAMPLES OF TRELLO - SCREEN SHOTS OF TRELLO SET UP, OTHER EXAMPLES IF YOU HAVE SOME)

Do you want to do police checks? - (HOW TO GUIDE FOR DOING A POLICE CHECK NZ)

Do you want to do an orientation? At an orientation the new member can learn about Timebanking - EXAMPLES OF INFO THAT COULD BE INCLUDED IN AN ORIENTATION at what stage do you want to organise an orientation?

Once the person is signed up they will need to become a member of the platform you are using - CW3 SIGN UP LINK AND INFO ABOUT OTHER TIMEBANKING PLATFORMS THAT COULD BE USED
