# Membership and Administration

When setting up a Timebank you will need to decide on a sign up process. Can the person sign up solely online or do they need to meet in person? Here is an example of a sign up process... [Timebank Membership Workflow](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aX72oQ8eHg-DUvBkyz47sffFZZ38cxj-LiOR9mYOI5s/edit). 

If you decide it can be done online then you can either use CW3 directly - you will receive an email when a new member signs up, and you can then respond directly to this with an email with sign up details. Here's an [example email](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q1QbZX53q4rygu3c_iIsbTDhAoqq25Eisecd4m2jy9g/edit?usp=sharing)

When you use online forms, such as this [ Jot Form](http://form.jotform.co/72362960301854) and this [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1q-hw5Qgo5Tejgci-n2oolA-McxZBhy-oh9api9Lw8jY/edit) they will create a user database automatically. These can be sent to [Google Sheets](https://www.jotform.com/help/228-how-to-integrate-forms-with-google-sheets/) or [Airtable](https://www.jotform.com/integrations/airtable), where new members are immediately placed into your spreadsheets. 

These automatic tasks are called "integrations" and provide you with lots of possibilities. You could also use an integration to send an automatic email.  [Jot form and MailChimp](https://www.jotform.com/integrations/mailchimp). You'll find that integrations for all the major services.


Keeping track of your sign up process - where are you in the process? What tools can you use to keep track of this? [Here's a document used by Wellington for this purpose](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QohoeF2x2u6Jd0ZjTrWHhBckYo9rbARhRGlVbe1o9OE/edit)


Reference checks for new sign ups - if you decide to do reference checks, how might you conduct these - you could do it the old fashioned way by calling the referees, or you could use an online form [Here is an example of a form for referrees](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1M2FeahoeAsj_bykBzbHVlYbnYZo-lmh4ytXcfiaBiOM/edit)
