# Membership and Administration

## When setting up a Timebank you will need to decide on a sign up process. 
Can the person sign up solely online or do they need to meet in person? Here is an example of a sign up process... [Timebank Membership Workflow](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aX72oQ8eHg-DUvBkyz47sffFZZ38cxj-LiOR9mYOI5s/edit). 

If you decide it can be done online then you can either use CW3 directly - you will receive an email when a new member signs up, and you can then respond directly to this with an email with sign up details. Here's an [example email](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q1QbZX53q4rygu3c_iIsbTDhAoqq25Eisecd4m2jy9g/edit?usp=sharing)

When you use online forms, such as this [ Jot Form](http://form.jotform.co/72362960301854) and this [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1q-hw5Qgo5Tejgci-n2oolA-McxZBhy-oh9api9Lw8jY/edit) they will create a user database automatically. These can be sent to [Google Sheets](https://www.jotform.com/help/228-how-to-integrate-forms-with-google-sheets/) or [Airtable](https://www.jotform.com/integrations/airtable), where new members are immediately placed into your spreadsheets. 

These automatic tasks are called "integrations" and provide you with lots of possibilities. You could also use an integration to send an automatic email.  [Jot form and MailChimp](https://www.jotform.com/integrations/mailchimp). You'll find that integrations for all the major services.


## Keeping track of your sign up process 
Where are you in the process? What tools can you use to keep track of this? [Here's a document used by Wellington for this purpose](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QohoeF2x2u6Jd0ZjTrWHhBckYo9rbARhRGlVbe1o9OE/edit)


### Reference checks for new sign ups
If you decide to do reference checks, how might you conduct these - you could do it the old fashioned way by calling the referees, or you could use an online form [Here is an example of a form for referrees](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1M2FeahoeAsj_bykBzbHVlYbnYZo-lmh4ytXcfiaBiOM/edit)

### Code of Conduct for your Timebank

You may want to establish a formal code of conduct. Here's a [model code of conduction in PDF format](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SxoA0sDgS-nIdRFcdNO_9v1awpeoo-Q7-BfRKNyU-ek/edit?usp=sharing) and [here it is again as an online form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScAl_eN-I9tiIjfa7beo9aqjIDy1l03X44VMLGP3rAZm20Gug/viewform?usp=sf_link).

### Do you want to do police checks? 

In New Zealand you can obtain a [Ministry of Justice criminal record check](https://www.justice.govt.nz/criminal-records/get-someone-elses/) or a [Police Vetting](http://www.police.govt.nz/advice/businesses-and-organisations/vetting).

There are small fees for both of these services. At the time of writing it they were about $11 per request.

`TIP` [individuals can apply to obtain their own criminal record](https://www.justice.govt.nz/criminal-records/get-your-own/) from the Ministry of Justice. At the time of writing itâ€™s free to request a copy of your own criminal record. 

Organisations providing services to vulnerable people (this includes children, older people and people with special needs) can ask the [New Zealand Police to vet](http://www.police.govt.nz/advice/businesses-and-organisations/vetting) (check) people who want to work or volunteer for them.

#### Compliance for Organisations that do Criminal Record Checks
Organisations that request criminal records checks [must  demonstrate that they understand the laws that apply](https://www.justice.govt.nz/criminal-records/get-someone-elses/compliance-assurance-check/). The compliance checks must be performed annually. 


### Do you want to do an orientation? 

Think about what stage in the process that you want to organise an orientation. This document lays out [a plan for the important steps to cover from sign-up to orientation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1unViW-gAMgcoyXf_9eGpXqm_ElzC81EW/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=107264652407614741759&rtpof=true&sd=true).

At an orientation the new member can learn about Timebanking - and discover what further steps are needed to join. 

Here is a [sample agreement form for members](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1H38uPwDBd_zU3FfH9PCmPNTJDdz4KWJF/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=107264652407614741759&rtpof=true&sd=true). 

Here is [an orientation setup manual for organisers](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ur4KnHxYjW8xIW5hbzPwzEW8-Vlze7-PLewuktXrqWs/edit?usp=sharing) 

Here is an [orientation day hand-out for new members](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QohoeF2x2u6Jd0ZjTrWHhBckYo9rbARhRGlVbe1o9OE/)



## Now you have a new member
Once the person is signed up they will need to become a member of the platform you are using. 

If they haven't already signed onto the platform at the start of the process, you want to ensure that they get onto your platform and become familiar with it. 

Orientation days offers a chance to do this. If you have a group they can be self-assisting, and that encourages them to meet one another.
