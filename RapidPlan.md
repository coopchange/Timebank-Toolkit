## How it works
  
**Capturing**  
Write down all the tasks you need to accomplish this week.  
  
**Chunking**  
Chunk your tasks together by commonalities. Which items are personal? work-related? Career-focused?  
  
**Create your own RPM blocks:**  
On the top of a new sheet of paper, make three columns: Task, Result, Purpose

List the task, the result you want from completing that task, and your purpose for completing it. Next, list the actions you can take to get there.  
  
**Create an empowering role for yourself**  
You might call yourself the “Coordinating Queen.” Anything that will get you jazzed about completing your goal.
