# Community Weaver 3

[Home](https://fyodorovich.github.io/Timebank-Toolkit/) | [Onboarding](https://fyodorovich.github.io/Timebank-Toolkit/Onboarding.html)

[Community Weaver 3](https://timebanks.org/communityweaver3/) is the current software platform for Timebanks provided by [Timebanks.org](https://timebanks.org/timebanks/) when you start a Timebank.

You'll want someone in your group who is comfortable being able to configure and administer Community Weaver to manage your Timebank. This guide will provide you with some basics, some warnings and some tips. 

## Warning
Due to our [email server hardware failure](https://wiki.timebanks.org/wiki/TimeBank_Email_Address), the site email address is temporarily out of service. Email sent to the CW site's email address will not be sent to coordinators. Please inform your members of this issue and that they will need to send their emails directly to a coordinator's email address. We regret this disturbance to communications with your timebank members and are currently working to resolve this issue.
## Managing a CW3 Site
### Coordinators
#### Types of Coordinators

There are five different coordinator roles, each has a special set of tasks.

Admin, Member, and Member Support are able to do stuff for members.

You can assign coordinator roles to lots of people, so they share the workload.

You can also assign multiple coordinator roles to a single person
