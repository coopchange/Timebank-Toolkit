# Building a Community 

## Getting People to be Members 

The process of generating a relationship of this sort has been closely studied in sales and marketing where the potential for profits is a motivator. Timebank may not have a for-profit motivation but we want the same broad outcomes. The clear message from all of the marketing advice is that [developing a relationship with people in your community is a process](Onboarding.html). It requires a lot of input from you and you need to nurture your new members.   
 

## Which Sign up form?  
      
If your timebank _does not have any restriction on who becomes a member_ then you can use the CW3 registration tools. Do this by checking the “Allow anyone to sign up” checkbox in the config area. It’s on by default.   
      
If you have any _restrictions or requirements_ for new members then you may want to control the signup process yourself. This will enable you to inform your prospective members of the information that they need to supply and provide a way for them to begin the process.   
      
If you have a custom sign up form, you need to turn option “allow anyone to signup” option OFF and redirect users to your sign up form. CW3 doesn't make it easy to roll-your-own sign up procedure. The best that we can suggest is that you use a “Special Page” that is pinned to your home page. In that page you can direct users to your custom built signup form.
