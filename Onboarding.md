# Onboarding! Getting the People in your Community through the Sign-up Procedure

[Community Weaver](https://fyodorovich.github.io/Timebank-Toolkit/CommunityWeaver.html) | [Onboarding Software](https://fyodorovich.github.io/Timebank-Toolkit/OnboardingSoftware.html) 

Your group leaders will have to decide how much scrutiny to place on people who want to join your Timebank. In the New Zealand context that may involve asking for a Police Background check, personal references, or personal identity documents. 

Onboarding processes can take time and energy for everyone involved. They also have the potential to deter people from joining. Many other platforms only require users to provide an active email address and a "good faith" verification that they meet the entry requirements for that group. In contrast, a lengthy process can leave people by the wayside. They lose interest and may not be energetically committed. 

> Engaging with people who are joining as they navigate this process can be the key to building an active community.

## Managing the Process

Placing requirements on new members increases your responsibility to manage the process that entails. At the very least you will need to have a clear idea of what you are asking and what is involved. Especially as you will very likely need to assist someone who is having to do as you have asked.

### Being Organised
Think about what you need to do to manage this process. 
1. Who is involved?
2. How do you find out?
3. How do you keep track?
4. How frequently do you contact them?
5. How much support can you provide?
6. How long do you expect it to take? 
7. How much time can you give?


#### Software 
If your group only has a small number of new memberships occurring at any time you may be able to manage the onboarding process in your head or with a notebook/diary. Once your needs go beyond what you can easily handle you will benefit from having some assistance. This can be in the form of more people engaged in the administration effort. Do that by all means. But also consider using software to facilitate these tasks.
