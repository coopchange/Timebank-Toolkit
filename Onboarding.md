# Onboarding
_Onboarding is one of the most important jobs for a coordinator_

## Getting through the Sign-up Procedure

### Your role is to manage a vibrant community. 
1. Where do those people come from? 
2. Did you find them or did they find you? 
3. Now that you have found each other, how do you convert them into an active and supported Timebanker?

In the sales/marketing manuals they often say that there are seven touchpoints needed to convert a lead. [What are the seven touchpoints involved for Timebank?](Sales_cycle.html)

The process of generating a relationship has been closely studied in sales and marketing. Timebanks may not have the same motivation but we want the same broad outcomes. The clear message from all of the marketing advice is that developing a relationship with people in your community is a process. It requires a lot of input from you and you need to nurture your new members. 


## Establishing Identity and Trust
> Engaging with people as they navigate this process can be the key to building an active community.

Your group leaders will have to decide how much scrutiny to place on people who want to join your timebank. In the New Zealand context that may involve asking for a Ministry of Justice background check, personal references, or personal identity documents. 

These processes can take time and energy for everyone involved. They also have the potential to deter people from joining. Many social platforms only require users to provide an active email address and a "good faith" verification that they meet the entry requirements for that group. In contrast, a lengthy process can leave people by the wayside. They can lose interest and may not be energetically committed. 


### Requirements for CW3
The administrator will have selected some options for the sign-in form. When joining, the email, first name, last name and password fields are required. All other fields are optional. 

### Requirements for your Community
- [ ] MOJ / Police Check
- [ ] Personal Identity Documents
- [ ] Photo ID
- [ ] Referees

## Managing the Process

Placing requirements on new members increases your responsibility to manage the process that entails. At the very least you will need to have a clear idea of what you are asking and what is involved in meeting your request. Especially as you will very likely need to assist someone who is having to do as you have asked.


### Being Organised
Think about what you need to do to manage this process. 
1. Who is involved?
2. How do you find them?
3. How do you keep track?
4. How frequently do you contact them?
5. How much support can you provide?
6. How long do you expect it to take? 
7. How much time can you give?


#### Software 
If your group only has a small number of new memberships occurring at any time you may be able to manage the onboarding process in your head or with a notebook/diary. (No - we're not kidding). Once your needs go beyond what you can easily handle you will benefit from having some assistance. This can be in the form of more people engaged in the administration effort. Do that by all means. But also consider using software to facilitate these tasks.
