# Seven Stages of the Sales Cycle - For Timebanks

Timebanks can benefit from the enormous amount of research into human behaviour that has been performed by market researchers. The language used may not seem to be completely appropriate because it has come from a completely different area. We've retained it here because it is well established and can be easily used for any subsequent research or activity that you do.

## Prospecting<a name="Prospecting"></a>
**Finding your audience** For timebanks, the prospecting phase may consist of outreach **communications**, **advertising**, **events**, and **web presence**. 


## Making Contact<a name="Making_Contact"></a>
This usually means your audience contacting you, via the **web site**, **email**, or **social feeds**. If you are at an event, you may be the one to **start up a conversation**. 
* online enquiries

## Qualifying the Lead<a name="Qualifying_the_Lead"></a>
Not every timebank has entry requirements but those that do need to determine whether the lead can join the group. This may be as simple as asking for a photo ID. It could involve asking for and checking with their referees; by a background check, such as Ministry of Justice provides. These processes are designed to ensure that the entire group has a level of assurance that the people they'll meet are genuine and trustworthy. 

## Nurturing the Lead<a name="Nurturing_the_Lead"></a>
Not everyone will sign-up immediately, some people are shy or cautious and need more assurance before they will participate. **Introduction days** and **training days** provide an opportunity to spend time with one or a small group to build trust with your new members.  

## Making an Offer<a name="Making_an_Offer"></a>
A timebank has a lot to offer a new member. A timebank is a a treasure, after all. Something very tangible, which is easy for a new member to understand, is a **gift of credit** as a welcome gesture. 

According what's achievable within your community you may also provide **welcome packs**. These could be actual packs made of gifts from members or groups. 

## Handling Objections<a name="Handling_Objections"></a>
There is no need to hard-sell but some people will need more help than others. They may experience **technical difficulties**, **access issues**, or social issues. Be prepared to help these people into the community. 

## Closing the Sale<a name="Closing_the_Sale"></a>
We've been told that establishing a succesful trade as soon as possible is a good indicator. The longer it takes a new member to close their first sale, the less likely they are to commit. This could happen for all sorts of reasons, but as a rule of thumb, **you want to get a new member trading as quickly as possible**.
