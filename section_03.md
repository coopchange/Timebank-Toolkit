# Running a Timebank 

## Communications and Networking/Engagement 

Regular communications are a really valuable part of building your membership. Email is a good place to start because it is easy and it is everywhere. 


### Newsletters 

#### How often will you talk with your members?

Everyone has a different level of engagement so you want to target your audience. Most timebanks are engaging in a weekly post with some opting for a monthly mail out. 


### No one likes SPAM
Your timebank platform will auto-generate some email. Make it communicate - don't let it become imprersonal and spammy.  [Here's some examples](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q1QbZX53q4rygu3c_iIsbTDhAoqq25Eisecd4m2jy9g/edit) 

### Sending Mail
Sending mail is big business and there are a lot of different providers. 

[Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com), [Mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com/pricing/) and [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com) are commonly used because they have low entry costs for small volumes. 

`TIP` All of the bulk email suppliers have bracket pricing models that are based on *number of emails being sent* and sometimes the *number of people in your address book*. Shopping around will get you the best deal.

If you are using **WordPress** for your website you can easily connect to [**Mailgun**](https://www.mailgun.com/pricing/) and [**SendGrid**](https://sendgrid.com) using *a plugin* dedicated to that purpose. Your web developer will think that is a piece of cake.

### Social Media Tutorials

[Social Media Examiner](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCS3lFRhXKfCZ8FvRqPjy9NA) is a Youtube channel that provides marketing advice. 

These videos are produced in the USA for wanna-bee influencers and work-from-home-millionaires. All teasing aside, the tutorials contain good advice and strategies, which are bundled into very slick buy-me-now packages. 

Community groups can learn a lot from these marketing techniques. You have to make changes to be relevant to your group but the underlying methods remain the same. And that includes the buy-me-now messaging. Your "product" is different to theirs but you still want to have people knocking on your door to join and participate. 

### Creating Content


Here's an example of how we're using Canva in a Timebank context,

### Volunteers
You'll need help. For some of you, that means learning to share the workload.

Volunteers come in all shapes and sizes. You have to look after them. Having [a volunteer introduction / guidebook](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14YmqUD1mnOcBjsM_rhH3Bgpm40ED4Y7T/view) that they can refer to and learn from is a great way to do this. 

### Monthly meetings and organisation

Think that building a team of volunteers is hard? Wait until you try to find a time when they will commit to meet for an hour! 

[Doodle](https://doodle.com/en/) provides on online service for scheduling meetings. 

[Calendly](https://calendly.com) is another that is highly recommended for calendars and scheduling.
