## Timebank Toolkit

# Key Findings

We found that the motivating value for timebank coordinators is the wellbeing that comes from connecting with people in the community and nurturing those relationships. This is heart-centered activity. 

The majority of their time is spent in four domains: [onboarding](Onboarding.html), [outreach](Outreach.html), engagement and [administration](Administration.html).

Coordinators felt most successful when **onboarding** was quicker, and more personal; when **outreach** events were attended and appreciated; when **administration/compliance** could be performed easily. In other words, when their activity corresponds with their motivations. 

Time spent in **onboarding** and **administration** domains is dominated by legal, bureaucratic, and administrative tasks that are numerous, necessary, and more or less difficult, according to the personal skills of the coordinator. 

The domain of **engagement** encompasses and extends beyond **onboarding** and **outreach**; it is, however, harder to provide effective technological solutions for the many varied ways that people engage in that more relational aspect of the work.

The broad purpose of the [toolkit](index.html) is to enable coordinators to be productive in these areas.
