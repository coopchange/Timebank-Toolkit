# Sharing and Improving the Toolkit

The toolkit is hosted by Github and managed using a version control system. This enables us to invite and accept changes from you. We can do this easily because the system manages the process of modification, additions, and deletions. We can monitor every single change, rolling backwards and forwards with only a few mouse-clicks. 

Behind the scenes is a continuous deployment system. This watches our repo, and if there are any changes it will proccess them. That ensures that updates to the toolkit repo are reflected in the web site within 15mins of us editing anything. 

If you want to participate, set up an account on Github and fork the toolkit. When you are ready, send a pull request through.
