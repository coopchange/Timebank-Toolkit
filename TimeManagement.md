# Time Management Techniques

``TIP`` _Time and management techniques are easy to implement_
           
It can be overwhelming to have a lot of things to do, especially when they all have different needs and actions. Fortunately, there are some great strategies for handling busy and complex workloads. They all differ a bit, and that's partly because we all have different approaches, and partly because different situations are better suited to a different approach. For that reason, its good to have a few different strategies and use the one that fits best. 

Applying good time management techniques can reduce your workload and ensure that you make time for yourself.
