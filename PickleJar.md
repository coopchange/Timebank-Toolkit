# Pickle Jar Theory  
  
This theory helps you figure out what is useful and what is not useful in your daily life. It allows you to plan tasks with time to spare and set priorities for your day.

## How it works
  
Imagine a pickle jar full of sand, pebbles, and rocks. The sand is at the bottom and the rocks sit at the top.  
  
**The sand**  
This represents disrupting elements of your day, such as phone calls, text messages, emails, social media, etc.  

**The pebbles**  
This represents tasks that need to be completed, but can be done on another day or by someone else.  

**The rocks**  
These are the most important tasks that need to get done today. 
 
Begin by thinking about how your tasks for the day would fit into the above categories. Then make a task list starting with the rocks and ending with sand (if time permits). Include an honest time estimate next to each. Try not to plan more than six hours of an eight-hour working day. This will leave buffer time for the pebbles and sand.
