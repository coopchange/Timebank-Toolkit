# Administration Coordinator

``TIP`` *There can be more than one admin coordinator. This allows you to share the workload*. 

The admin coordinator has full control of the timebank, so it is a "high trust" role.

The admin coordinator may also be responsible for managing the timebank in a general way. This includes managing a team, controlling resources, being a custodian of the history, responsibility for spending money, and for accounting for money earned. 

## Community Weaver

An important role for the admin is to setup CW3.Â Use the guide to [configuring community weaver](CommunityWeaver.md) to help set up CW3

## Meeting the Needs of the Organisation

### Software, the Office, and the Team

Having a good set of tools for the office that your team all use is one of the keys to getting things done easily. You want to be able to share your work, and collaborate, without having the email documents back and forth. There are lots of great tools, so the real issue is which ones to use. Check out  [the Organisation guide](Organisation.md) to help meet your software needs

### Documenting your Activity

``TIP`` 
> Put aside twenty minutes at the end of the day to record the important things that you did during the day. It will put you in a really good place when it comes to reporting. 

As the admin you'll have to look after the business side of running a timebank. There will also be the social role, and that's a really important part of the job too. If you have an outreach coordinator they will be doing this but often everyone plays a part in the outreach, so you'll find yourself doing this too. 

&#128210; You could use a calendar, or a spreadsheet, or a diary. Use whatever you prefer but do try to keep it in one place. 

&#129395; For social events, keep pictures, video, and sound recordings.

&#128176; Be especially careful to keep track of money coming in and going out. 



### Fiscal and Legal Responsibilities

*Meeting your fiscal and legal responsibilities is more than we can cover here.*  

Keep a record of what you do and you will be well placed to meet your reporting responsibilities.
