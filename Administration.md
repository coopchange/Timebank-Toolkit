# Administration Coordinator

``TIP`` There can be more than one admin coordinator. This allows you to share the workload. 

_The admin coordinator has full control of the timebank, so it is a "high trust" role_

The admin coordinator may also be responsible for managing the timebank in a general way. This includes managing a team, controlling resources, being a custodian of the history, responsibility for spending money, and for accounting for money earned.

### Documenting your Activity

You could use a calendar, or a spreadsheet, or a diary. Use whatever you prefer but do try to keep it in one place. 

For social events, keep pictures, video, and sound recordings.

Be especially careful to keep track of money: money coming in and going out. 

Spending five minutes at the time or putting aside twenty minutes at the end of the day to record the important things that you did will put you in a really good place when it comes to reporting. 

### Fiscal and Legal Responsibilities

*This area is outside the scope of the toolkit*

Meeting your fiscal and legal responsibilities is a lot more complicated than simply keeping track of everything. However, if you do keep track of everything you will be well placed to meet your reporting responsibilities. Include the date and time, any spending or income, and an explanation of the activity.
