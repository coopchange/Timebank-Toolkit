# Collaborating Online

> Applications running online, are also called services, software as a service (SaaS), or platforms. 
> All of these collaborative suites run online, so it does not matter which operating system you use
> They can be used from desktop, laptop, tablet, or mobile

``TIP`` Collaborating online is easiest when everyone uses the same tools.

## The Back Story
Collaborating traditionally required a group of people to be in the same space. The infrastructure of the internet now provides that space. During the last ten years, online services have developed that allow groups of people to collaborate in a multitude of ways. Scrapbooking (Facebook), Diaries (Instragram, Twitter), and Blogs/Vlogs (WordPress, Youtube, Tik Tok) led the way in collaboration tools and shaped a lot of our thinking and behaviour. They were considered suitable for fun, non-essential, recreational activities. It was individual activity that occurred in a common space. In line with that attitude, business had been slow to engage (for many different reasons). Collaborative functions arose within the communal space, but in many ways it wasn't . When pandemic responses undertaken globally in 2020 forced workforces to stay home that attitude shifted. Keeping colleagues away from the shared spaces that they were accustomed to normalised the need for business to utilise online resources. The demand for online collaborative tools exploded. 

## Office Suites
Collaboration tools suitable for businesses of all sizes, across all sectors, are readily available. Driven by the huge influx of income and demand during the last two years, the range, quality, and functionality of these services has improved enormously. 

We are look at suites of collaboration tools from [three service providers: Google, Microsoft, and Zoho](OfficeSuites.html).
