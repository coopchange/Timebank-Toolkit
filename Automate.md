# Automating your Workflow
              
## Aggregating your Work

When you have lots of the same thing to do, something that you will repeat, you want to have a strategy that scales well. You want to reduce the amount of time required to do the work and you don’t want to repeat things unnecessarily.   
  
The first thing to think about is which parts of the job can be synthesised. Some parts of the job are unique and have to be done individually. Some parts of the job are common to every item and these are the things that you want to do once or as little as possible.   
  
When you do a job once you start at the beginning and work through to the end. Most of us will have a sequence for performing jobs that makes sense and it works. Lots of jobs have sequence that you need to follow. There are things that go first and things that go last. But in the middle the sequence might not matter much. When you are doing a task a lot you’ll probably find that some ways are quicker or easier than others and these become your preferred technique.   
  
When you break the jobs into the parts that are common and the parts that are unique it will probably upset your normal sequence. You might need to do all of the unique things first, then do all of the common things, or _vice versa_.   
  
Another thing that you may find is that you are using tools are designed to do one job at a time. This forces you to repeat your work. You want to find tools that allow you to batch actions together, or find new ways to use your tools.   
  
You’ll also notice that the some of the common tasks you can do once to all of the items. Doing something once is a good thing for humans. But some of the common tasks you will have to do over and again for every item. Doing something over and again is a good job for robots.
