## Managing your Workload <a name="Managing"></a> ##

_What techniques can we use to manage our work?_

The way to reduce your workload depends on the type of work you are doing. Are you repeating the same thing with minor variations or are you managing lots of things that are different from one another? Most of us will find that we need to do both: manage a variety of jobs and 
do somethings a lot.  

``TIP`` 
>When you have lots of the same thing to do: [aggregate and automate these jobs](Automate.md)

``TIP`` 
>Apply a [time and management technique](TimeManagement.md) that suits the situation
              
  
## Getting People to be Members  <a name="Members"></a>

This is one of the most important jobs for a coordinator. Your role is to manage a vibrant community. Where do those people come from? Did you find them or did they find you? When you have found each other, how do you nurture and support them to [become an active and committed Timebanker](Members.md)?
