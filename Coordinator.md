## Managing your Workload <a name="Managing"></a>

_What techniques can we use to manage our work?_

The way to reduce your workload depends on the type of work you are doing. Are you repeating the same thing with minor variations or are you managing lots of things that are different from one another? Most of us will find that we need to do both: manage a variety of jobs and 
do somethings a lot.  

``TIP`` _When you have lots of the same thing to do: [aggregate and automate these jobs](Automate.html)_  

``TIP`` _Apply a [time and management technique](TimeManagement.html) that suits the situation_  
              
  
## Getting People to be Members  
  
This is one of the most important jobs for a coordinator. Your role is to manage a vibrant community. Where do those people come from? Did you find them or did they find you? When you have found each other, how do you nurture and support them to become an active and committed Timebanker?  
  
The process of generating a relationship of this sort has been closely studied in sales and marketing where the potential for profits is a motivator. Timebank may not have a for-profit motivation but we want the same broad outcomes. The clear message from all of the marketing advice is that [developing a relationship with people in your community is a process](Onboarding.html). It requires a lot of input from you and you need to nurture your new members.   
 

* Which Sign up form?  
      
    If your timebank does not have any restriction on who becomes a member then you can use the CW3 registration tools. Do this by checking the “Allow anyone to sign up” checkbox in the config area. It’s on by default.   
      
    If you have any restrictions or requirements for new members then you may want to control the signup process yourself. This will enable you to inform your prospective members of the information that they need to supply and provide a way for them to begin the process.   
      
    If you have a custom sign up form, you need to turn option “allow anyone to signup” option OFF and redirect users to your sign up form. We suggest you use a “Special Page” that is pinned to your home page. In that page you can direct users to your form.

### Setting up CW3  
  
* CW3 Help Pages  
    Link: [wiki.timebanks.org/wiki/Community_Weaver_3][4]  
  
    * The help pages address two different groups of readers: coordinators and members  
    * TRAP: The information in the help pages can be confusing. Often there is no information, just a lot of links leading you in circles.  
    * The online Community Weaver manual for coordinators

    * TIP: Do your own tests. Ensure your settings are working the way that you expect them to.  
    * General  
        Link: [wiki.timebanks.org/wiki/TimeBank_General_Settings][8]  
  
        * Identity  
            * The information you provide here will be used at the top of the page and at the bottom of the page.  
            * Site Name  
                * Appears at the top left of the page in bold and same colour as the theme. Also appears at the bottom left with the address and telephone number.  
            * Email Subject Brand  
                * This is used to identify email by prefixing the subject with this text in square brackets. It would be a good idea to keep this fairly short.  
            * Slogan  
                * This is displayed beneath the logo, which appears on most pages.  
            * Footer Message  
                * This can be HTML. You can includes images, text formatting, and CSS. We don’t suggest that you try to include javascript/ECMAscript as it would probably conflict with the CW3 code.  
            * Site Email Address  
                Link: [wiki.timebanks.org/wiki/TimeBank_Email_Address][9]  
  
                * This email address is used by CW3 to direct communications to coordinators  
                * CRAP  
                    * At the beginning of 2022 it is broken and has been broken for some time.  
            * Postal Address  
                * WARNING: This address is displayed at the bottom of every page and in emails. It will definitely be indexed by search engines.  
            * Phone Number  
                * WARNING: This number is displayed at the bottom of every page and in emails. It will definitely be indexed by search engines.  
        * Features  
            * The choices you make here controls the behaviour of CW3.  
            * Signup Page  
                * Allow anyone to signup as a member?  
                    * When checked, anyone can sign up  
                        * Pros  
                            * Easy to sign up  
                        * Cons  
                            * Hard to manage who signs up  
                            * If you have referee checks, or  any other requirement, such as identity validation, then you may need a different sign up form. For a user, having to sign up multiple times is confusing and can undermine confidence.  
                    * WARNING: If you allow anyone to sign up there is more to do. Go to Configure->Signup and follow the instructions there.  
            * Member Privacy  
                * Check this box at all times  
                    * Pros  
                        * MEMBER PRIVACY!  
                    * Cons  
                        * Cannot share user offers/requests with FaceBook  
            * External Links open in new window  
                * Generates a new browser tab for links outside CW3. This setting benefits users who are younger than the internet.  
            * Default Ad Expiration  
                * Choose the period that you think best suits the sort of exchanges for your group. Users can override this easily, but if they don’t need to change it, there is less friction in the offer/request process.  
            * Facebook  
            * Facebook Like Page  
            * Twitter  
            * Twitter User Name  
            * If you have a Facebook group, use this setting to put social buttons on the page and link to your group  
            * If you have a Twitter account, use this setting to put social buttons on the page and link to your account  
        * Language and Text  
            * Localise your settings.  
            * These settings are important. You should set them appropriately.  
            * In Aotearoa / New Zealand the settings would typically be  
                * Default Country: New Zealand  
                * Language: English  
                * Time Zone: Auckland  
                * Restrict Member Time Zones: Pacific  
    * Sign Up  
        Link: [wiki.timebanks.org/wiki/TimeBank_Signup_Settings][10]  
  
        * Step 1: Sign Up  
            * Allow anyone to sign up?  
                * This is the same as the checkbox in General->Features. (But in this case, its in the right place)  
            * You may not want this option checked.  
            * If you have a custom sign up form, you need to turn this option OFF and redirect users to your sign up form. We suggest you use “Special Pages” to either present your form or to redirect users to your form.  
        * Step 2: Profile  
            * TIP  
                * Be frugal with these options. Use the absolute minimum.  
                    * Time Zone  
                        * Pointless in NZ  
                    * Neighbourhood  
                        * USA-centric. In NZ we have suburbs and don’t usually need any further breakdown.  
                        * Users who enter their address will have included their suburb already. Asking for their “neighbourhood” is a duplication.  
                        * If you are going to use this you MUST provide a list of neighbourhoods.  
                        * If you do not use this, ensure that the list of neighbourhoods is empty.  
                        * GOTCHA: Users enter neighbourhoods that are not in your list.  
                        * GOTCHA: The implementation is a bit messy. You’ll find places where “neighbourhood” is an option.  
                    * County  
                        * USA-centric. Could be useful in wide-spread groups but the language is wrong, so you may not get reliable inputs.  
                        * If you use this you MUST provide a list of “counties”  
                        * If you do not use this make sure the list of counties is empty.  
                        * GOTCHA: the implementation is messy. You’ll find places where “county” is an option.  
            * TRAP  
                * If users do not provide answers to every one of the options you select their profile will not be marked as 100% complete.  
            * CRAP  
                * CW3 actives recommends that MOST of options that they offer SHOULD NOT BE USED

            * CRAP  
                * You can only provide one logo file  
                * If your logo was not designed to fit in a circle, or was not designed for portrait mode, you will be unhappy.  
            * TIP
