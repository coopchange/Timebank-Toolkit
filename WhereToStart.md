# Where to Start - for non-computer-thingy People

If you are not into computers **at all** this may help you figure out how to get started. 


## Are you going to do this job more than once? 

### No - Thankfully!
``TIP`` If you are only going to do a job once - don't use the computer. 

``TRAP`` There are exceptions to this rule, but it's a pretty good rule. 

### Yes - Curses!
Computers are really good at repeating things. The first time (and maybe the second time,
