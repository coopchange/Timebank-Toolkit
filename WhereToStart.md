# Where to Start - for non-computer-thingy People

If you are not into computers **at all** this may help you figure out how to get started. 


## Are you going to do this job more than once? 

### No - Thankfully!
``TIP`` If you are only going to do a job once - don't use the computer. 

``TRAP`` There are exceptions to this rule, but it's a pretty good rule. 

### Yes - Curses!
Computers are really good at repeating things. The first time (and maybe the second time, 
and possibly the third time) you do something on a computer it is time-consuming. 
At some point, there is less to do because everything is already in place and you 
only need to make a few changes. 

``TIP`` If you are not a computer person use your phone or a tablet as much as possible. Phone and tablet apps are designed for non-geeks. 

## What does the job involve? 

### Information about People
Names, Phone numbers, email addresses, Social accounts. 

### Words
All word processors have the same set of behaviour. You start typing and keep going until you are done. They all have **bold**, *italic*, and _underline_.

If you are sending a document to someone, don't expect them to use the same word-processor that you are using. Send them a PDF copy.

### Email
The important tips for email are about sending email to more than one person. 

If you are sending email to a small number of people and you expect everyone to stay in the loop, put their email addresses in the To field, or the CC field.

If it is a one-off email that you are sending to a big group put their email addresses into the BCC field. These people can reply to you but they can't reply to the whole group. 

### Numbers
Use a spreadsheet for anything that involves keeping track of numbers. They are really good at that. 

``TIP`` People often use spreadsheets to arrange things neatly in columns.  

``PRO`` It works pretty well, and also suggests that you are a super-organised person who is into spreadsheets. 

``TRAP`` At some point you will want to print your list or do something else with it and it will look awful, or print over three pages sideways. 

### Dates
Use your Calendar, Reminders, To-Do lists
