# Pomodoro Technique  
  
The Pomodoro Technique was created by entrepreneur and author Francesco Cirillo. This technique uses a timer to break down your work into intervals. Each interval is known as a _Pomodoro,_ named after the tomato-shaped timer that Cirillo created.

## How it works
  
1.    Choose a task you need to get done 
  
2.    Set a timer (e.g., for 25 mins)  
  
3.    Focus on the task at hand
  
4.    When the timer rings, put a checkmark on a piece of paper  
  
5.    Take a short break  
      Take a break for about three to five minutes. Go for a walk, grab a cup of coffee, do something non-work-related to give your brain a break.  
  
6.    Repeat steps two to five   
      Once you have completed this process four times, you can begin to take longer breaks (20â€“30 mins).
