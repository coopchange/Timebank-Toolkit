# First Steps to Becoming a Timebank

The scope of this section is to provide you with enough information for you to setup a timebank. The primary activities are outlined here.

## Create a Core Group
This includes finding your board, getting volunteers, setting governance, roles and responsibilities. 

If you have funding for employment you may be wondering how to advertise. These [samples for job descriptions and advertisements](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TDQ5WNSo4x3H7I3vQ_-JCl06B2YpnI32?usp=sharing) at Mid-Canterbury Timebank can be a guide.


## Secure Funding
Obtain fiscal sponsors, or support from an umbrella organisation, or become an organisation. 

**Open Collective NZ** helps you to operate like a company or charity, without having to incorporate or manage one. [https://www.opencollective.nz](https://www.opencollective.nz)

**Community.net.nz** has information about the umbrella groups. [https://community.net.nz/resources/community-resource-kit/umbrella-groups](https://community.net.nz/resources/community-resource-kit/umbrella-groups)

**Charities Services** explains the difference between an incorporated society and a charity in New Zealand?

## Build Community
Promotion and building awareness about Timebanks, such as creating social media, and getting people involved. Having a clear description of your organisation, your aims, and your purposes is a good way to begin. Creating an information sheet is also a good way to clarify these things. 

These documents can be as simple as a plain-print [information sheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17VyrrhWBV_lZhbVknuDJGlRv3M8IU2Lz/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=107264652407614741759&rtpof=true&sd=true) or as lush, and well designed as this [handbook for the Mid-Canterbury Timebank](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Z3z9h-UN3WJwJnQxuBZJ0e0RyGpLKOJr/view?usp=sharing).

The processes are described in more detail in [How to Build a Timebank](https://timeexchange.co.nz/images/Resources/Startup/How-to-Build-a-TimeBank.pdf).

## Running activities
Keeping your community engaged requires continuous contact in one form or another. Create lots of different activities throughout the year as a way to bring people together.<br><a href="activityCalendar.md">Here's an example calendar</a>




## Website
It is a good idea to have a Timebank Website of your own - for when people search your timebank on google, this might have some info about your Timebank, what is a Timebank, and might direct new members to your sign up form, and members to the Timebanking platform that is being used.
