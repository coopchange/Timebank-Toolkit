This includes finding your board, getting volunteers, setting governance, roles and responsibilities. 
## 2. Secure Funding
Obtain fiscal sponsors, or support from an umbrella organisation, or become an organisation. 
## 3. Build Community
Promotion and building awareness about Timebanks, e.g., create Social media, getting people involved
## 4. Choosing your platform
 for Timebanking (CW3, other options etc)
## 5. Running activities 
(a template calendar with different events in diff months)
## 6. Website
it is a good idea to have a Timebank Website of your own - for when people search your timebank on google, this might have some info about your Timebank, what is a Timebank, and might direct new members to sign up via G form, and members to the Timebanking platform that is being used.
