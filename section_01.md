# First Steps to Becoming a Timebank

The scope of this section is to provide you with enough information for you to setup a timebank. The primary activities are:
<dl> 
<dt>Create a Core Group</dt>
<dd>This includes finding your board, getting volunteers, setting governance, roles and responsibilities. </dd>
<dt>Secure Funding</dt>
<dd>Obtain fiscal sponsors, or support from an umbrella organisation, or become an organisation. </dd>
<dt>Build Community</dt>
<dd>Promotion and building awareness about Timebanks, such as creating social media, and getting people involved</dd>
</dl>

The processes are described in more detail in [How to Build a Timebank](https://timeexchange.co.nz/images/Resources/Startup/How-to-Build-a-TimeBank.pdf). 

<dl>
<dt>Choosing your platform</dt>
<dd>There are several platforms that can be used. Depending on your size and your intentions.</dd>
<dd>Read the discussion of <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/15vyl1RpmJBHJXYlia0Pwt5mB9eSSUq0MTYGDxQfwlYg/edit?usp=sharing"> the current options for time banking platforms</a></dd>
<dt>Running activities</dt>
<dd>Keeping your community engaged requires continuous contact in one form or another. Create lots of different activities throughout the year as a way to bring people together.<br><a href="activityCalendar.md">Here's an example calendar</a>
</dd>
<dt>Website</dt>
<dd>it is a good idea to have a Timebank Website of your own - for when people search your timebank on google, this might have some info about your Timebank, what is a Timebank, and might direct new members to your sign up form, and members to the Timebanking platform that is being used.
