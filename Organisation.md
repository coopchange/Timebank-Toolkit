 ## Cloud Backup  
  
What is the difference between Cloud Backup and Cloud Storage offered with by Google, Microsoft and Apple?  
  
Documents that are in the cloud don’t really need an external backup service.   
  
These companies store your documents on systems that are always accessible. So, any documents that you create using these services are going to be stored. In addition, there are options for recovering deleted documents within the first few months.   
  
  
Cloud Backups are services designed to store entire hard drives, except for the operating system.
